# Predictive Analytics for Electricity Price Forecasting

## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing the forecasting of electricity prices through the improvement of fundamental variable predictions, specifically load, wind generation, and solar generation. It replicates and extends the findings of the research article titled "Enhancing load, wind and solar generation for day-ahead forecasting" by Katarzyna Maciejowska, Weronika Nitka, and Tomasz Weron. The study investigates biases in forecasts published by Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and explores the effectiveness of regression models in improving these forecasts to better predict spot and intraday prices in the German electricity market.

### Background

Energy is a crucial element in modern life, impacting households, businesses, and industries. The dynamics of electricity pricing are influenced by various factors, including fuel prices, maintenance, policies, and environmental issues. Recent trends towards deregulation have led to the emergence of competitive electricity markets, particularly day-ahead markets, where transactions take place based on forecasts.

The project aims to validate and extend the original research findings using the same methodologies and datasets while incorporating additional methods and models. The goal is to enhance the understanding of how these fundamental variables influence electricity market prices.

## Summary of Results

The research analyzes key variables such as total load, wind generation, and solar generation in Germany, supplemented by temperature forecasts for major cities. The dataset spans from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2019, and includes day-ahead and intraday market prices, as well as the actual and forecasted values of the fundamental variables.

The original study utilized ARX-type models for forecasting, revealing significant improvements in load forecasting compared to TSO benchmarks, while the enhancements in wind and solar predictions were less pronounced. The improved forecasts facilitated better decision-making for electricity trading, leading to notable financial benefits, including a substantial increase in revenue.

In replicating these findings, the study confirmed improvements in load forecasting accuracy and explored the complexities of wind and solar forecasting. The incorporation of innovative models demonstrated enhanced predictive capabilities, yielding better results across various fundamental variables.

### Key Findings

- Load forecasts improved significantly over TSO benchmarks.
- Wind and solar generation predictions showed modest enhancements.
- Improved forecasts led to substantial financial gains in electricity market decision-making.
- The study emphasizes the importance of using accurate forecasts for effective trading strategies.

## Conclusion and Future Research

The replicated study reinforces the value of enhanced fundamental forecasts in predicting electricity market prices. While improvements in load forecasting were consistent, challenges in solar forecasting remain. The research highlights the financial incentives for using refined predictions and suggests avenues for future work, including expanding datasets and further model enhancements.
